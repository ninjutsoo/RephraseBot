## 🎨 Anti-Spam Variation Strategy

The bot uses **6-dimensional randomization** to ensure each rephrase is unique:

### Multi-Dimensional Parameters
Each message is rephrased with randomly selected:

1. **Structure** - How sentences are organized (3 options)
2. **Length** - Target output length variation (5 options)  
3. **Tone** - Formality and emotion level (6 options)
4. **Sentence Style** - Short vs long, punctuation patterns (5 options)
5. **Word Choice** - Vocabulary complexity and variety (6 options)
6. **Additional Style** - From 171 curated style variations

**Total combinations:** 3 × 5 × 6 × 5 × 6 × 171 = **463,050 variations**

---

## 🛡️ Rate Limiting (Optional)

**Default:** Disabled (0 seconds)

To enable rate limiting, set `RATE_LIMIT_SECONDS` to your desired cooldown (e.g., `30` for 30 seconds).

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### Channel Filtering
Restrict the bot to only process messages from specific channels.

**Configure:**
- Set `ALLOWED_FORWARD_CHANNEL` in environment variables
- Use channel username (without @) or channel ID
- Leave empty to allow any channel

### Best Practices
- ✅ Keep repository private on GitHub
- ✅ Rotate API keys regularly
- ✅ Never commit `.env` files
- ✅ Use secure environment variables for secrets

**⚠️ If you ever exposed your API keys** (in chat, public repo, etc.):
1. **Telegram:** Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) → regenerate token
2. **Gemini:** Delete and create new key at [AI Provider Console](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
3. Update environment variables immediately
